Team Name: Project Acapella Video - Team 34

Team Members: Alexander Brebenel (ab5181), Alexandra Nana (an2907), Andrei Oprisan (ao2775), Carlos Raymundo (cgr2134)

This demo is for COMSW4170 - Final Project Report - Project Acapella (group 34), showcasing one key component of the user experience that we tested and found compelling feedback from our design loops to actually build out.

This is a static React JavaScript project. No compilation or installation of packages is required. Simply open up index.html and the site should render to a timeline view.
